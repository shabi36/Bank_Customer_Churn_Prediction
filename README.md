# 🏦 **Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
Customer churn is a major challenge for banks, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project applies **machine learning** 🤖 to predict whether a customer will leave the bank (**churn**) based on various demographic, financial, and transactional factors. By identifying **at-risk customers early**, banks can take proactive measures to improve customer retention.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to develop a **binary classification model** that predicts customer churn, classifying customers into:  
✅ **Not Churn (0):** Customers likely to stay.  
❌ **Churn (1):** Customers at risk of leaving the bank.  

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can enhance decision-making and improve customer experience.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset includes key attributes influencing customer behavior:  
👤 **Demographics** – Age, Gender, Geography  
💰 **Account Details** – Balance, Tenure, Number of Products  
📈 **Activity Metrics** – Credit Score, Transaction History  

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to ensure optimal model performance.  

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**  
We explore multiple ML models to identify the best performer:  
⚡ **Logistic Regression**  
🌲 **Random Forest Classifier**  
🔥 **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  
🎯 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

The best model is selected based on key metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  

## 🔄 **Workflow**  
🔹 **Data Preprocessing**  
   - 🛠️ Load and clean the dataset.  
   - 📊 Handle missing values & outliers.  
   - 🔢 Encode categorical variables.  
   - 📏 Normalize numerical features.  
   - ✂️ Split data into **train** and **test** sets.  

🔹 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - 🏋️ Train multiple machine learning models.  
   - 📊 Compare performance using evaluation metrics.  
   - 🔍 Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.  

🔹 **Prediction & Interpretation**  
   - 🎯 Use the best model for predictions.  
   - 📌 Identify key factors influencing churn using **feature importance (SHAP, permutation importance)**.  

## 📈 **Results & Future Improvements**  
🏆 The final model achieves **high accuracy & ROC-AUC score**, proving effective for predicting churn. Future enhancements may include:  
🔹 **Feature Engineering** – Extracting more meaningful features.  
🔹 **Deep Learning** – Using neural networks for better performance.  
🔹 **Explainability Techniques** – Enhancing model interpretability with SHAP & LIME.  

## 🚀 **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can help banks **predict customer churn**, enabling them to **retain valuable customers** through data-driven insights. By understanding the factors influencing churn, banks can enhance customer experience, reduce attrition, and boost overall business performance. 💡📊
